To integrate the code from C to ROCm, you'll need to follow these steps:

Include the ROCm header file: Include the hip/hip_runtime.h header file to access the ROCm API.

Identify parallelizable code: Identify the parts of your C code that can be parallelized and executed on the GPU. These are typically loops that perform independent computations on each element of an array or data structure.

Create device functions: Convert the parallelizable code into device functions using the __device__ keyword. These functions will run on the GPU.

Launch kernels: Launch GPU kernels using the __global__ keyword and specify the execution configuration (grid and block dimensions) to distribute the workload across GPU threads.

Memory management: Allocate and manage memory on the GPU using HIP memory management functions like hipMalloc, hipMemcpy, and hipFree.

Synchronization: Use synchronization primitives like __syncthreads() to ensure proper ordering of memory accesses and execution within a thread block.

Error handling: Check for errors using HIP error checking functions like hipGetLastError and hipPeekAtLastError.
